A history of markup languages
-----------------------------

By Tibs / Tony Ibbs

.. The slightly shorter version.
..
.. This is intended to fit within 25 minutes.

This version for the Write The Docs, Prague, 2018

Written using reStructuredText_.

Converted to PDF slides using pandoc_ and beamer_.

Source and extended notes at https://github.com/tibs/markup-history

.. _reStructuredText: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html
.. _pandoc: https://pandoc.org
.. _beamer: https://github.com/josephwright/beamer

.. |TeX| replace:: :math:`\text{\TeX}`

.. |LaTeX| replace:: :math:`\text{\LaTeX}`

.. Slide notes are in notes-per-slide.rst - they're too long to fit
.. comfortably in the presenter notes, and this file reads better if
.. "following along" on github without the extra notes being inline.
..
.. Also, it's not clear that pandoc/beamer/PDF supports presenter notes
.. in the way I'd want.

.. Full notes (and links) are in markup-history-extended-notes.rst

  Thoughts on ``Why I like children's books'':

  \beginlist
  \item{\blob} They aren't afraid to show a sense of wonder.
  \item{\blob} They aren't `duty bound' to include love
  interest for the sake of it.
  \item{\blob} They are rarely cynical, rarely bitter---but
  the best do not avoid tragedy and truth.
  \item{\blob} They are willing to teach the simple lessons
  of being human---which adult books so often scorn, but
  which we all need to learn and relearn.

  <l>To touch its wings but not its eyes with
