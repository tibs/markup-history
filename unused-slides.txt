Digital Standard Runoff
-----------------------

.. code:: roff

    .TITLE A simpler DSR example
    .CHAPTER This is a chapter

    This is the first paragraph.
    .LIST
    .LIST ELEMENT;This is a list element. We have *bold\* and
    &underline\&.
    .LIST ELEMENT;This is another list element. I like
    interrobangs ?%!
    .END LIST

.. note:: I'm not sure anyone else is interested in DSR, and I don't think
   it gives any extra information over talking about the roffs in general.
   Perhaps mention it in passing.

   integrated Schematron rules.

1994: POD
---------

::

  =pod

  =head1 DESCRIPTION

  This is not I<really> representative of POD usage.

  =over 2

  =item This is a list item.

  =item This is another list item.

  =back

  =cut

.. note:: 1994 POD *Presentational*. Still in use today.

  Perl's "Plain Old Documentation".

  Same year as wikiwikiweb

  An example of markup to a specific purpose, and clearly very successful.

  Note that the blank lines are required around the POD commands.

  I don't think you can do multi-paragraph list items. The POD definitions
  contains ambuguities, although how to handle some of them is explained in
  the POD documentation.

1995: Javadoc
-------------

::

  /**
   * Short one line description.
   * <p>
   * Longer description. If there were any, it would be here.
   * <p>
   * And even more explanations to follow in consecutive
   * paragraphs separated by HTML paragraph breaks.
   *
   * @param  variable Description text text text.
   * @return Description text text text.
   */
  public int methodName (...) {
      // ...
  }

.. note::  **skippable** javadoc

  1995 javadoc *Presentational*. Still in use today.

  Has never specified the subset of HTML it allows.

1991: setext
------------

::

  Why setext?
  -----------

    I agree that FAQ's would best be written in something like setext_.
    Why?  Because this document is written in setext and it includes
    the ability to embed HTML hypertext links without being obnoxious.

    As you can see it's easy to write setext documents, and as Edward
    pointed out, it uses existing text conventions for **bold** and _italic_
    words and titles.

  .. _setext http://www.bsdi.com/setext/
  ..

.. note:: 1991 setext *Presentational*. Lightweight.

  Ian Feldman, for use in writing the TidBITs electronic newsletter.

  Excerpted from a document called "Why setext".

  Partly a reaction to SGML. Clearly influential on
  all of the succeeding lightweight markups.

  Same year as HTML
