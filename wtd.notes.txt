Notes for Write The Docs, Prague, 2018
======================================

This is the branch for working on the version of the talk for Write The Docs
in Prague, 2018.

25 minute talk

Q: Leave out mention of StructuredText?

  - Do non-Python people really care about it / need to know about it
  - Does reStructuredText make sense without it?
  - i.e., can I explaing reStructuredText enough with only a mention of it?

Specialisms:

- reStructuredText: readable first (cf: Python)

  Refuses to be output format specific, refuses to try to do everything (doing
  everything would compromise readability). Can't use ``_`` for
  italics/emphasis because Python uses leading/trailing underscores, and want
  to write about Python easily.  Similarly, can't treat ``<`` and ``>``
  specially, because want to discuss XML and so on (and also things like
  ``<name>`` to represent an abstract concept, which is a common sort of
  notation).  - asciidoc: lightweight docbook, wants to be as complete as
  reasonable - markdown: lightweight HTML

Other notes:

* Check I mention DITA in the notes. People seem to want to use markdown to
  write it.

* orgmode - no real specification, defined by its (Emacs) implementation.

  (There is a bit of a spec, but it's incomplete?)
